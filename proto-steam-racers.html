                    Steam racers is a game about racing in the brand new racing machines, finally making it possible to have organised races for prizes and amusement.<br>
                    Step into one of the four steam racers, rev up the engine and race through the pipe system and over the slippery ice lake to be the first to finish all three laps.<br>

                    <h1 class="ui title header">CONCEPT</h1>
                </div>

                <p>The concept of Steam racers is fairly simple: it’s a multiplayer racing game. You and up to 3 other players race against each other. You control your car with a steering wheel and pedals, keeping the controls simple. No need to shift gears; just steering, gas and brake/reverse.</p>
                <p>The race track contains patches of snow that will slow the racer down and a small section of ice, where the racer can easily spin out due to the slipperiness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h1 class="ui title header">DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                </div>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Gameflow</h4>
                <div class="ui grid">
                    <div class="thirteen wide column">
                        <p>There was already a system in place that made sure that when a component was placed, its details (variation ID and reference to the mesh) were replicated to the other clients. Upon placing a new part, the lamp is first updated and an “UpdateVisuals”-function is called on the lamp.</p>
                        <p>The issue was that some components would require a change in material based on the state of the lamp: The power core can have a certain color and the bulb should reflect said color.</p>
                        <p>The very first idea was to let an artist make a material that contained variables (such as a variation float or color vector) that could be set in the code.Later we decided that it would be better to instead keep a list of materials in the lamp itself (each part their own list). That way an artist has far more control over the end visual of the material without the implementation side requiring any changes.</p>
                        <p>So in the end implementation, when a part is placed we check what part it is. Based on that switch output we call that part’s respective function in which the material can be changed or some animation can be triggered.</p>
                        <p>The decision for a function per part was chosen so we won’t end up with a single enormous function but split it up in a bit more readable bite-sized chunks.</p>
                        <p>This was later extended by adding holographic materials for the two upcoming parts (so players can see what parts they need to place now and what’s about to come up. This follows the same principle (setting the entire material, rather than setting variables).</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">score</h4>
                <p>(Almost) all PROTO games provide the player with some score value at the end of the game. To make all game scores more connected, they all follow a certain score format, something we called “score standardisation”: a “decent”-rated player should get roughly the same score in every game.</p>
                <p>The document that outlines all the score standardisation values/calculations can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmhcqowj3kmb5dg/Score%20standardization.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>.</p>
                <p>Obviously Steam racers is all about racing, so the time it took you to finish the race is a logic variable. The place you finished in wasn’t very usable, due to the huge differences in skill that could exist (a very poor player playing against even worse player could get a better score than a decent player versus very skilled players).</p>
                <p>Instead of translating your race time to score directly, it’s taken in accordance to the maximum possible race time and the time that we consider perfect (optimised route). Without this it’s very hard to tweak the score output, as the time variable would have to be inverted: little time = high score, a lot of time = low score.</p>
                <p>To solve this, a percentage is calculated, with the finish time over the maximum game time. Subtracting the expert time from these two variables provides a neat zero to one range.</p>
                <p>The different gradings were defined by taking less optimal routes or making a lot of mistakes (such as spinning out on the ice a lot). These values were later confirmed by putting an experienced player vs a new player behind the wheel.</p>
