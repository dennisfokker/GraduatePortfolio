                    Light factory is a game about working in a brand new, state of the art, factory. Work effectively with your co-worker to make sure you meet the high demands.<br>
                    Assemble a high-tech lamp piece by piece, but make sure you put on the right variation! Sadly you don’t have all the parts on your bench, so coordinate with your co-worker who has to perform what tasks.<br>

                <p>Light factory is a two-player cooperative game. In that game a conveyor will pass by the two players: one on the left side, the other on the right. Each player has a sub-portion of all possible lamp pieces and as the orders come in they have to coordinate the construction between each other.</p>
                <p>While all lamps consist out of the same set of parts, they differ in the specific variation of a part they take (e.g. a round or square-shaped housing).</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">part variable materials</h4>
                <p>There was already a system in place that made sure that when a component was placed, its details (variation ID and reference to the mesh) were replicated to the other clients. Upon placing a new part, the lamp is first updated and an “UpdateVisuals”-function is called on the lamp.</p>
                <p>The issue was that some components would require a change in material based on the state of the lamp: The power core can have a certain color and the bulb should reflect said color.</p>
                <p>The very first idea was to let an artist make a material that contained variables (such as a variation float or color vector) that could be set in the code.Later we decided that it would be better to instead keep a list of materials in the lamp itself (each part their own list). That way an artist has far more control over the end visual of the material without the implementation side requiring any changes.</p>
                <p>So in the end implementation, when a part is placed we check what part it is. Based on that switch output we call that part’s respective function in which the material can be changed or some animation can be triggered.</p>
                <p>The decision for a function per part was chosen so we won’t end up with a single enormous function but split it up in a bit more readable bite-sized chunks.</p>
                <p>This was later extended by adding holographic materials for the two upcoming parts (so players can see what parts they need to place now and what’s about to come up. This follows the same principle (setting the entire material, rather than setting variables).</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">score</h4>
                <p>(Almost) all PROTO games provide the player with some score value at the end of the game. To make all game scores more connected, they all follow a certain score format, something we called “score standardisation”: a “decent”-rated player should get roughly the same score in every game.</p>
                <p>The document that outlines all the score standardisation values/calculations can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmhcqowj3kmb5dg/Score%20standardization.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>.</p>
                <p>Light factory is a fixed-length game (the games takes an x amount of minutes with a mostly-constant supply of lamps). This means that the only real variable is how well you constructed every lamp.</p>
                <p>Lamps can have some pre-placed parts, which means the player will start off having to place only the last 2 pieces. As the player gets familiar with the controls, the game will scale down to the point the player will have to place all parts. This is important to know, as the lamp grading only takes into account the amount of to-place parts.</p>
                <p>Lamps can be graded in 4 levels (best to worst): perfect, great, okay and awful. Perfect means all correct parts were placed, great means &#62;66% of all correct parts were placed, okay means &#62;33% and awful &#60;33%. Each grade provides 100 more points than the lesser (where awful provides 0 points). The 100 is used to get a neat whole number output, instead of some decimal. The ratios were constructed with the scaling of pre-placed components and speed of the conveyor in mind. At first people might make a few mistakes but the visual and auditory feedback should let them understand that there are specific variations they should put on. These values were first defined by testing the game and roleplaying as a player with certain skills. These percentages were rounded into multiples of 5 for a rough estimate. This was later (somewhat) confirmed when letting players of several skill levels (experience/skill with the game and games in general) play the game. Minor tweaks were introduced later on based on testing and to create a logical score curve.</p>
