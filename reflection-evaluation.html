                <div class="intro">
                    <p>I requested for a peer review two times: once roughly mid-way through my internship and one near the end. A summary document can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj1itn5hcej17zk/Peer%20review%20summary.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>. This contains summary graphs of all the answers, links to the documents that contain the full answers provided and links to the forms themselves.</p>
                    <p>A reflection on the received reviews, a personal review and evaluation can be found below.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h3 class="ui title header">Reflection peer reviews</h3>
                </div>

                <p>The questions are constructed based on previous peer review documents from Fontys and adjusted to be related to Enversed’s workflow.</p>
                <p>Simply looking at the summaries of the graphs (even after the transformation suggested in the summary document), a clear increase can be seen. Going from a 4-5 score to a 5-6. Applying the translation, this would form an approximate score going from 4.3 to 4.8 (on the scale provided in the summary document).</p>
                <p>Given their feedback, they find me a reliable and social colleague, providing a healthy work environment that helps with getting stuff done quickly, but properly. On the other side I can get a bit nit-picky or stubborn, making certain discussions last longer than they should.</p>
                <p>Virtually all the feedback provided in the peer reviews is something that was in-line with how I see myself, or new but something I could agree with.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h3 class="ui title header">Personal reflection</h3>
                </div>
            
                <p>A lot of the things I see in the peer reviews are things I would’ve noted myself (such as being very proactive in the team, but occasionally being a bit too firm on my ideas).</p>
                <p>Before my internship started, I wrote down three subjects I felt like I could improve upon or should exploit during my internship. They are listed below with my reflection on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Communication: discussions can take longer than they should, as I can have issues separating issues of primary importance from those of secondary importance.</i>
                    While it’s still something I need to work on, I do believe it’s going better. It’s something everybody at my previous internship noticed, but it’s only noted as a minor thing during this one. I keep a better view of the total scale of the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Independance: I request for feedback in a timely fashion without being a nuisance or wasting too much time attempting to fix something myself.</i>
                    This was a strength noted during my first internship, and still very well seems to be the case. I keep a good rhythm between when I ask for help and when I think I can fix it myself within a manageable timeframe. I also always provide plenty of information about what the problem is, what my theories are and what I have already tried, providing much faster support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Perfectionism: Are my products of proper quality, without spending far too much time on components that won’t matter in the end.</i>
                    This was a weakness that has haunted me for most of my studies. This somewhat joins up with the primary/secondary importance issue. I think I provide structured reviews without hammering on too much detail (“letting it slip” or informing informally). I believe this also comes forth in my general pace of work, eventually declaring it “Good enough”, even though I would much rather make it much more extensive (which simply won’t be needed for the current use-case).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h3 class="ui title header">Evaluation</h3>
                </div>
            
                <p>The internship started a bit under-par for my personal taste, but this was mostly since I didn’t have an extensive knowledge of Unreal Engine and its networking yet. As the internship progressed my tasks passed reviews much quicker and I could also provide valuable insight on the reviews of other people.</p>
                <p>The documentation part started fairly well, working on it a few hours a week, but near the middle I started to slip up until eventually coming to a halt, which quickly came to bite me back near the end.</p>
                <p>I believe I performed all my tasks in a structured manner, making the best out of less-optimal situations where previous people left off. I do believe I should have made more calls for refactoring, where the current quality of the codebase would start to become hard to read or expand upon.</p>
