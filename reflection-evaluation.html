                <div class="intro">
                    <p>I requested for a peer review two times: once roughly mid-way through my internship and one near the end. A summary document can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj1itn5hcej17zk/Peer%20review%20summary.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>. This contains summary graphs of all the answers, links to the documents that contain the full answers provided and links to the forms themselves. Keep in mind that the names are redacted and have been replaced with their role (for context).</p>
                    <p>A reflection on the received reviews, a personal review and evaluation can be found below.</p>

                    <h3 class="ui title header">Reflection peer reviews</h3>
                </div>

                <p>The questions are constructed based on previous peer review documents from Fontys and adjusted to be related to Enversed’s workflow.</p>
                <p>Simply looking at the summaries of the graphs (even after the transformation suggested in the summary document), a clear increase can be seen. Going from a 4-5 score to a 5-6. Applying the translation, this would form an approximate score going from 4.3 to 4.8 (on the scale provided in the summary document).</p>
                <p>Given their feedback, they find me a reliable and social colleague, providing a healthy work environment that helps with getting stuff done quickly, but properly. On the other side I can get a bit nit-picky or stubborn, making certain discussions last longer than they should.</p>
                <p>Virtually all the feedback provided in the peer reviews is something that was in-line with how I see myself, or new but something I could agree with.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h3 class="ui title header">Personal reflection</h3>
                </div>
            
                <p>A lot of the things I see in the peer reviews are things I would’ve noted myself (such as being very proactive in the team, but occasionally being a bit too firm on my ideas).</p>
                <p>First off, I’d like to reiterate that most colleagues find me to function on a junior or even medior level. While I stand my ground that they probably underestimate what medior means, it still provides a sound indication they agree I work on a good level.</p>
                <p>Based on the frequency subtasks are rejected, I can draw the conclusion my analysis skills are up-to-par to what a company like Enversed would expect from an employee. The same counts for my designs. Even when working on more complex systems and creating a design document is it generally minor feedback or requests for further explanation, which is accepted upon providing it. The fact that I sometimes have to provide more information is something that should be noted though, whether I had already thought about it or not: I should be more thorough when documenting my ideas, thoughts and findings.</p>
                <p>My management skills seem to go very well too. I utilise the workflow and tooling very well and can provide thorough explanation or feedback on the how’s and the why's. My supervisor did mention that he didn’t feel like it was quite on the level to create an entire workflow for the team as a whole, however. This is mostly due to the lack of a company-level overview.</p>
                <p>While the implementations I make are fine for their intents and purposes, I could put more effort into making solutions which are truly ground-breaking (whether on a company level or the game industry as a whole).</p>
                <p>Before my internship started, I wrote down three subjects I felt like I could improve upon or should exploit during my internship. These are listed below with my reflection on them.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Communication</h4>
                <p><i>Communication: discussions can take longer than they should, as I can have issues separating issues of primary importance from those of secondary importance.</i></p>
                <p>While it’s still something I need to work on, I do believe it’s going better. It’s something everybody at my previous internship noticed, but it’s only noted as a minor thing during this one.</p>
                <p>In order to improve on this front I’ll have to better keep in mind the stage of the project (i.e. beta or release). This is a sound suggestion coming from the full-time artist (on my review speed): “From time to time you are however too nitpicky while reviewing especially when keeping in mind the scope, time left of a project or if the tasks is final or not. This slows the whole reviewing process down”. Another possible method could be to limit the amount of slack-messages/minutes in a discussion I use. This won’t be a hard limit, but passing this will provide a threshold and which I should quickly reflect on whether or not more time is needed on the issue.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Independance</h4>
                <p><i<>I request for feedback in a timely fashion without being a nuisance or wasting too much time attempting to fix something myself.</i></p>
                <p>This was a strength noted during my first internship, and still very well seems to be the case. I keep a good rhythm between when I ask for help and when I think I can fix it myself within a manageable timeframe. I also always provide plenty of information about what the problem is, what my theories are and what I have already tried, providing much faster support.</p>
                <p>I’d like to keep my “independence” on the level its currently at, to prevent it from switching over into a weakness. To quote full-time developer 2 (listing my strong points): “Aware of everything that's going on in the projects/team, which is good”. This is something I want to keep up, having a birds-eye view of a team so I can jump in whenever needed, both to directly assist or to bring up issues or good practices during a retrospective.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Perfectionism</h4>
                <p><i>Are my products of proper quality, without spending far too much time on components that won’t matter in the end.</i></p>
                <p>This was a weakness that has haunted me for most of my studies. This somewhat joins up with the primary/secondary importance issue. I think I provide structured reviews without hammering on too much detail (“letting it slip” or informing informally). I believe this also comes forth in my general pace of work, eventually declaring it “Good enough”, even though I would much rather make it much more extensive (which simply won’t be needed for the current use-case).</p>
                <p>To quote the full-time artist (on my review quality): “In my opinion one of your better qualities as your reviews are mostly spot on even on tasks that aren't your specialty such as art”. This shows my attention to detail is appreciated, even able to use this quality on fields I might not be proficient in. The method to assure my perfectionism won’t come too much in the way, I’d like to reiterate the method suggested for communication: set up a time limit when reviewing tasks and make a rough time estimation when working on tasks. These will provide the same kind of threshold at which point I can reflect on what I’m doing is really currently required.</p>

                </div>
            
                <p>The internship started a bit under-par for my personal taste, but this was mostly since I didn’t have an extensive knowledge of Unreal Engine and its networking yet. As the internship progressed my tasks passed reviews much quicker and I could also provide valuable insight on the reviews of other people.</p>
                <p>In the end there are 8 games produced (PROTO), components for a simulator (Sioux Holodeck, not contained within this portfolio), a licensing plugin and components for Enversed’s framework.</p>
                <p>6 of the PROTO games were showcased during the DDW. Whilst Steam racers initially had some issues these were resolved the next day. For the rest, all the games performed very well, entertaining a lot of guests and running in a way anybody could guide the experience, even without the technical know-how: with some simple directions the game runs itself.</p>
                <p>The development went mostly fine, although there were certain times at which a call for a refactor should have been made, either because the system was flawed from the start, or became unstructured due to addition upon addition.</p>
                <p>A thing I potentially need to look more at is making components more single-purpose, whether on something simple as dividing code up into smaller functions or by making a separate actor or component, rather than to add on code that’s already there, as this could result in excessively large actors which are hard to maintain and read.</p>
                <p>My proficiency within the company is further reinforced by having received a contract as a developer. Aside from developing the various applications, I also received the roles “organiser” and “solutions architect”. The task of an organiser is to manage the team, such as assuring the team correctly follows the workflow and works in an agile manner. A solution architect is a member who is present during certain meetings, providing feedback on if something is technically feasible or providing the initial designs or requirements on new bigger systems.</p>
                <p>My advice to the company is to certainly keep the review-process in place. It’s something I missed both in school and my previous internship and job, generally only coming at a later stage as one giant review meeting, which feels way worse than an occasional check here and there throughout the week.</p>
