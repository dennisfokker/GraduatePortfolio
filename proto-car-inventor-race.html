                    Car inventor race is a game about racing your new car invention to the exposition, which you are late for.<br>
                    Rush through the city in your car whilst swerving around traffic, avoiding pedestrians and crashing through pesky wooden blockades.<br>

                <p>You’ve just created a car with a new steering design: leaning. One player controls the car in VR, leaning left and right to evade all the obstacles in the car’s path. A second player can view the driver’s HMD view on a screen and will control the speed, able to go throttle from fast to slow, but never truly stop (you are late, after all).</p>
                <p>While the path the players have to take is linear, you do have full control over the car (unlike games like aircycle and balloon escape).</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">dynamic obstacles</h4>
                <p>Dynamic obstacles are obstacles that move around in various ways. At first the idea was to make the dynamic obstacle actor contain a static mesh itself, but this later changed to simply contain a reference to a different actor. This allows for easier custom behaviour in said actor (such as sounds and animations).</p>
                <p>A dynamic obstacle contains 4 different movement types: follow spline by time, follow spline by speed (later addition), translate by time and animate object.</p>
                <p>Most movement types should speak for themselves: there’s a spline that can be adjusted in the level that the actor will be moved along. Translation means a simple relative location and/or rotation change. Object animation doesn’t really do anything: it simply calls an interface function on the moved actor, which can implement its own animation logic (animations can optionally be ran with every movement type).</p>
                <p>Aside from this movement, looping has been implemented too. Later during development some dynamic obstacles weren’t one-time triggers anymore but had to constantly move around (such as a crane idly rotating back and forth).</p>
                <p>The looping types are: no looping, reverse looping (do the same movement backwards) and teleport looping (jump back to your starting position and start moving again).</p>
                <p>An image export of the blueprint can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8p9et3zskutb71l/DynamicObstacle-BP.png?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">score</h4>
                <p>(Almost) all PROTO games provide the player with some score value at the end of the game. To make all game scores more connected, they all follow a certain score format, something we called “score standardisation”: a “decent”-rated player should get roughly the same score in every game.</p>
                <p>The document that outlines all the score standardisation values/calculations can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmhcqowj3kmb5dg/Score%20standardization.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>.</p>
                <p>This game is literally a race against the clock, thus the time you have left is a logical variable for this game’s score. To provide a fair score for people who are unable to reach the destination, the distance travelled (how close are you at the destination, based on your location on a spline) is an addition to the total score.</p>
                <p>The ratio variable makes it so that every percent of distance travelled (to the destination) counts equal to a percent of time the player has left.</p>
                <p>The values were chosen by letting developers (experienced) and new players give the game a go. A player who has played the game multiple times or happens to be naturally very good at the game should be able to have 3 minutes left on the clock, whilst we see that every player should be able to reach at least about halfway to the destination.</p>
