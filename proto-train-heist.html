                    Train heist is a game about defending a new inventions which is in the process of being stolen by hijackers.<br>
                    Team up with your friend and shoot your waves through the bandits, making your way through the train to prevent them from taking away the invention.<br>

                <p>Train heist is a fairly normal shooter game. You and a friend can go through a linear map which is divided into sections. Stun all the baddies in your current section and you can continue on towards the next.</p>
                <p>As the difficulty increases with more open environments and more baddies, you eventually reach the end of the map, where you will be met with a short cinematic/animation to indicate victory.</p>
                <p>The players get a shield which regenerates after every section (so they can take 2 hits). Players are also revived upon completing a section. The enemies are stunned with just a single hit, knocking them out.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">play area indication</h4>
                <p>The players have a fairly large play area (bigger than 2×2 meters). In order to provide them an overview of where they can move around after teleporting, their play area will be made visible when they teleport, that way they can see if they’ll be able to move behind cover when teleporting to a certain location, or if they’re already too close to the edge.</p>
                <p>The very first iteration would use 4 spline meshes (one for each side). However this caused a bit more work for artists as they had to make a proper material and mesh for those meshes (and make sure they won’t cause clipping textures on the corners). The visuals itself would also be limited to just those edges.</p>
                <p>The next iteration used a plane instead, providing a lot more possibility with what to do for the visuals (the plane can potentially be changed to another square-shaped mesh). This plane is then simply scaled based on the play area points (extends are calculated). These points can be retrieved through the Oculus or Vive plugins in the editor.</p>
                <p>The above-mentioned plane can finally be placed wherever the player’s teleport indicator is, offset by where the player is within their room setup.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">score</h4>
                <p>(Almost) all PROTO games provide the player with some score value at the end of the game. To make all game scores more connected, they all follow a certain score format, something we called “score standardisation”: a “decent”-rated player should get roughly the same score in every game.</p>
                <p>The document that outlines all the score standardisation values/calculations can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmhcqowj3kmb5dg/Score%20standardization.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here <i class="fitted dropbox icon"></i></a>.</p>
                <p>The most obvious parameter to the score is the amount of baddies you’re stunned. However this would cause a fairly static end-score. In order to introduce a bit of variety in who plays the game perfectly and who just finished the game, the amount of times the player gets stunned is used as a penalty to the end score.</p>
                <p>At first there was also the idea to introduce completion time as a variable, but it proved very hard to balance and integrate into the formula and was thus scraped.</p>
                <p>Due to the high amount of baddies the player can stun, compared to the finite amount of times the players can get knocked out (the game stops when both players are knocked out), the knockout penalty can be fairly high, compared to other games. Counting just as much as stunning an enemy.</p>
                <p>The game was roleplayed with several levels of accuracy and wits in moving around (e.g. standing still in open spots or teleporting around to dodge bullets). Based on this several milestones for the different skill levels were constructed. These were later somewhat confirmed with playtests with new players (players tended to die very quickly on their first playthrough, but their second already went much better).</p>
