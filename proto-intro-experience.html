                    Intro experience is a game about you as an inventor, drawing out all the inventions: the ones you use in the other games.<br>
                    Trace the guiding line and see the created doodle come to life, into something you’ll get to operate later!<br>

                <p>The introduction experience of PROTO: get you first experience with VR and make sure it’s a simple, easy going game. Hold your pencil and start tracing the predetermined drawings after which they come to life to show the inventions that will be used in the later games.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ui vertical stripe segment">
                <div class="ui basic center aligned segment">
                    <h1 class="ui title header">DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                </div>
                <p>The drawing system went through several iterations. Whilst the base system stayed the same, certain changes were made as the experience either wasn’t very fun yet, or not polished enough.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Drawing V1</h4>
                <p>Drawings are created by shaping one or more splines (order maintained through tags). Upon spawning, it’ll go over all actors, creating point meshes (visuals) at all spline points and a spline mesh for every spline section between two points (since a spline mesh is only from point A to B and doesn’t support intermediate nodes).</p>
                <p>When a player touches a spline point (done through a distance check between the spline point and the tip of the pencil), the point is activated (texture animation) and the connected spline mesh is made visible (again, through a texture animation).</p>
                <p>Whenever a spline is finished, an animation can be fired and the next spline can be activated, until you finish all splines and thus the drawing is finished, triggering a different animation.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Drawing V2</h4>
                <p>The previous version created a feeling of “touch the dots”: you just touch a point, look where the next point is and touch that one.</p>
                <p>In order to create a more drawing feeling a “hint line” was added. This essentially was another state on the meshes that had a sort of transparent/greyed-out visual. These states were a simple float parameter in the material where some states had transitions (e.g. interpolate from 2.0 to 3.0).</p>
                <p>With this players roughly know ahead of time where they’ll need to move towards and can thus make a more continuous movement.</p>

                <h4 class="ui title header">Drawing V3</h4>
                <p>The points were still very distracting, and no feedback is provided whilst drawing. In fact, it was still a “touch the dots” experience, just with more visuals upon touching a point.</p>
                <p>This version actually allowed the player to draw. The points were completely removed, although they were still used in the back-end system. We use the “touched” points to keep track at what section of the player is (and if he has started/ended that specific spline). Furthermore the spline visuals now update live with where your pencil is on the spline: a bright blue line showing what you’ve drawn so far.</p>
                <p>Now you were finally drawing the inventions, a line showing up where your pencil passes over the hint line.</p>
                <p>Later this was extended with a few extra visuals, but these didn’t change anything noteworthy on a functional level.</p>
